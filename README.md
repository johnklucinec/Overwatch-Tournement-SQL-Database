Most of the code used in this was created by myself. If the code was not completely by me, it was adapted from either shadcn or TomDoesTech. If I did use or adapt any code, a disclaimer with a link will be at the top of each file.

## Introduction for shacn
### Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. **The code is yours.**
_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
